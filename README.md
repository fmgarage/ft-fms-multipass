#### What does 'FT' stand for? 

All our **FileMaker**-based projects and products are prefixed with an **F** and the **T** is for **tools, technology, tipps&tricks, techniques** or open **templates** for the community. These files are basically examples and demonstrations where you can copy stuff from and include it your individual apps and solutions.
