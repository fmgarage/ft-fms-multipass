=== Build and run Instance

Open Terminal.app, drag the `launch.sh` into the terminal window and hit return.

After the installation process is finished, the IP of the instance will be printed out by the script.
Also check the multipass menu, there should be a running instance named like set in `config.txt`.

Open the admin console by browsing to with `\https://<IP_from_output>:16000`.

Mind that:

* *Chrome* does not work without a valid certificate
* *Safari* lets you bypass the certificate warning
* *Edge* lets you bypass the certificate warning, but you need to append `https://`.

Clicking `Open Shell` from the Multipass menu will open a terminal window where you can use the fmsadmin command to control your server.
